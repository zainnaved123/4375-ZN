Are you satisfied that the package has found the best solution. How can you check. Explain.

No, I know that there are other regression libraries and models that could be used to predict the approximate age of the abalone from the chosen features. The reason I chose the features I did is because they had the most correlation to the age target value according to the heatmap. Because linear regression is searching for the line of best fit, for a category like age where many different things affect the age of the abalone. Maybe a classification model would have worked better. The randomness of the parameters affecting the accuracy is also another reason I may use a different model next time for this specific task on this dataset.
